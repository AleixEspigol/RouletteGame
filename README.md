# Roulette Game
## Abstract
Motivated by the continuous evolution and popularity of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I wanted to delve into the environment of Ethereum, one of the most renowned cryptocurrencies. For this reason I have developed a decentralized application (DAPP) that works autonomously on the Ethereum blockchain. The application in question corresponds to the roulette game, a game of chance well known in recreational and leisure centers such as casinos. The application I have developed for this game has the peculiarity that bets are made using cryptocurrencies, in this case ethers (the currency of Ethereum).

## Introduction
With this project, I wanted to develop a distributed application on Ethereum. The application in question, corresponds to the game of roulette. To be able to carry it out it has been necessary, on the one hand, a web interface, with which the customer can interact with, which will form part of the frontend. And on the other hand, a backend, which corresponds to everything the code and software needed for the application to work correctly on Ethereum and can be used by different users, in which there will be the server and the contract smart (smart contract).

### Aplication
It's necessary to install **npm package** after downloading the code. <br/>
If you want to interact with the application, you can do so by accessing the following link:<br/>
